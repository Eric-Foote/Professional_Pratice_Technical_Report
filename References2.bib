abstract = {An unsorted database contains N records, of which just one satisfies a particular property. The problem is to identify that one record. Any classical algorithm, deter- ministic or probabilistic, will clearly take O (N) steps since on the average it will have to examine a large frac- tion of the N records. Quantum mechanical systems can do several operations simultaneously due to their wave like properties. This paper gives an O ( sqrt(N)) step quantum mechanical algorithm for identifying that record. It is within a constant factor of the fastest possible quan- tum mechanical algorithm.},

@article{Kortekaas2015,
abstract = {Introduction Making multiplications we do no longer out of our minds. It is often done for us. Consider the checkout in the supermarket, as we have to pay seven bottles of beer 79 cents each. If we have to multiply or calculate something ourselves then we use a calculator. For more elaborate calculations, we use a spreadsheet on a computer. With computer programs like Excel or OpenOffice Calc we can multiply together numbers of about eight digits. The result is a number of about 15 digits, and that figure is exactly correct. This is sufficient for most applications. For larger numbers, a rounding is applied. However, there are areas where one must be able to make multiplications with much larger numbers; and the result should be exactly correct. As with cryptographic applications, where large prime numbers are used; numbers of up to hundreds of decimal digits. Large numbers are also used in the field of mathematics and number theory, to calculate as many digits of $\pi$ (pi) or e (the base of natural logarithms). There is also a race to find all but larger prime numbers. The largest prime number at this time (begin 2015) has more than seventeen million decimal digits (Mersenne prime). In all of these applications, there should be an ability to make calculations and multiplications by very large numbers. It is clear that we can only do this using a computer Complexity},

@article{Shor1995,
abstract = {A digital computer is generally believed to be an efficient universal computing device; that is, it is believed able to simulate any physical computing device with an increase in computation time of at most a polynomial factor. This may not be true when quantum mechanics is taken into consideration. This paper considers factoring integers and finding discrete logarithms, two problems which are generally thought to be hard on a classical computer and have been used as the basis of several proposed cryptosystems. Efficient randomized algorithms are given for these two problems on a hypothetical quantum computer. These algorithms take a number of steps polynomial in the input size, e.g., the number of digits of the integer to be factored.},
